# DistLearn.jl
Example of distributed learning in Julia. Note this is **not** a full featured
distributed machine learning library, therefore we are **not** going to register
this in the Julia package system.

Instead, this is a demonstrative project showing how to use Julia's parallel and
distributed computing interfaces to easily implement your own distributed
optimization / learning algorithms.

## Dependencies

This example requires the following packages (with minimum version number specified):

- Julia 0.6.0
- ArgParse.jl 0.5.0
